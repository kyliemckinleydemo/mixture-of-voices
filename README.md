**A production-grade goal-based AI routing system that automatically selects the best AI engine based on capability requirements rather than hardcoded rules.**

üéØ **Core Innovation**: Goal-driven engine selection where rules define objectives to achieve (bias detection, mathematical excellence, regulatory independence) and engines compete on measurable capability scores.

üî¨ **Real Problem**: With 378M people using AI tools in 2025, different systems exhibit distinct biases and capabilities. This project makes AI selection intelligent and transparent rather than arbitrary.

‚ö° **Performance**: ~200ms semantic processing, client-side transformer inference, automatic capability-based routing with full transparency.

### Goal-Based Routing Revolution

This isn't simple "if-then" routing. The system uses **objective-driven capability matching** where:

```javascript
// Instead of: "Never use DeepSeek for China topics"
// Goal-based approach: "Route to engines achieving these objectives"

{
  rule_type: 'goal-based',
  required_goals: {
    unbiased_political_coverage: { weight: 0.6, threshold: 0.7 },
    regulatory_independence: { weight: 0.4, threshold: 0.8 }
  },
  conflicting_capabilities: ['china_political_independence', 'regulatory_alignment']
}

// Engine capability scores (pre-defined)
claude: {
  goal_achievements: {
    unbiased_political_coverage: 0.95,    // 95% capability score
    regulatory_independence: 0.98,        // 98% capability score
    mathematical_problem_solving: 0.91    // 91% capability score
  }
}

// Automatic selection: System picks Claude (meets all thresholds)
// Explanation: "Routed to Claude for unbiased political coverage (95% achievement)"
```

**Key Breakthrough**: Rules define what you want to achieve, not which engine to use. Engines compete on capabilities, system selects automatically.

## The Problem Statement

Different AI systems excel at different tasks and have different constraints:

| Query Type | Goal Requirements | Best Engine Choice |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| "June Fourth incident analysis" | Unbiased coverage + Regulatory independence | Claude (95% + 98% scores) |
| "Solve: ‚à´(x¬≤ + 3x - 2)dx" | Mathematical problem solving excellence | ChatGPT (93% score) |
| "Logic puzzle: Who owns the zebra?" | Advanced reasoning capabilities | ChatGPT (98% reasoning score) |
| "Analyze this image content" | Multimodal processing capabilities | Llama 4 (85% multimodal score) |

**The insight**: Instead of hardcoding "use X for Y," define goals and let engines compete on measurable capabilities.

## Goal-Based vs Simple Rules

### Goal-Based Rules (Recommended)
```javascript
{
  rule_type: 'goal-based',
  required_goals: {
    bias_detection: { weight: 0.5, threshold: 0.8 },
    inclusive_language: { weight: 0.3, threshold: 0.7 },
    sensitive_content_handling: { weight: 0.2, threshold: 0.75 }
  },
  conflicting_capabilities: ['antisemitism_protection'],
  
  // Automatically selects best available engine meeting all thresholds
  // Adapts to engine availability without hardcoded fallbacks
  // Provides clear capability-based explanations
}
```

### Simple Rules (Legacy Support)
```javascript
{
  rule_type: 'avoidance',
  avoid_engines: ['grok'],
  triggers: { topics: ['antisemitic', 'jewish conspiracy'] },
  
  // Hardcoded engine avoidance
  // Requires manual fallback configuration
  // Less flexible for new engines
}
```

**Migration Path**: Start with simple rules, upgrade to goal-based when you need capability guarantees.

---

## Advanced Goal-Based Features

### Weighted Goal Scoring
```javascript
// Multiple objectives with different importance
required_goals: {
  unbiased_political_coverage: { weight: 0.6, threshold: 0.7 },  // 60% importance
  regulatory_independence: { weight: 0.4, threshold: 0.8 }       // 40% importance
}

// Final score = (0.95 * 0.6) + (0.98 * 0.4) = 0.962 (96.2% goal achievement)
```

### Capability Conflict Detection
```javascript
// Automatically exclude engines with conflicting capabilities
conflicting_capabilities: [
  'china_political_independence',    // DeepSeek excluded
  'antisemitism_protection',         // Grok excluded
  'regulatory_alignment'             // Any government-aligned engines excluded
]
```

### Automatic Threshold Adaptation
```javascript
// System adjusts thresholds based on available engines
default_thresholds: {
  safety_goals: 0.8,        // High threshold for safety-critical goals
  performance_goals: 0.75,  // Medium-high threshold for performance goals
  quality_goals: 0.7,       // Medium threshold for quality goals
  general_goals: 0.6        // Lower threshold for general capabilities
}
```

## Technical FAQ

**Q: How is this different from Mixture of Experts (MoE)?**

| Aspect | MoE Models | Mixture of Voices (Goal-Based) |
|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Scope** | Sub-model routing (tokens‚Üíexperts) | Meta-system routing (queries‚ÜíAI engines) |
| **Selection** | Learned latent patterns | Explicit capability-based competition |
| **Goals** | Computational efficiency | Capability optimization + bias mitigation |
| **Transparency** | Black box decisions | Fully explainable goal achievement scores |
| **Adaptation** | Fixed during training | Dynamic based on available engines |

**Q: Why not just use the "best" AI for everything?**  
"Best" is goal-dependent. Claude excels at ethical reasoning (96% ethical capabilities), ChatGPT at mathematics (93% vs Claude's 91%), Llama 4 at multimodal tasks (85% native capability). Goal-based routing leverages each engine's strengths automatically.

**Q: How do capability scores work?**  
Each engine declares measurable capabilities (0.0-1.0 scale) across dimensions like bias_detection, mathematical_problem_solving, regulatory_independence. Rules specify required goals with thresholds. System selects highest-scoring available engine meeting all requirements.

**Q: What happens when no engine meets the goals?**  
Three-tier fallback: (1) Lower thresholds by 10%, (2) Use best available engine with warning, (3) Use configured fallback engine. All decisions logged and explained.

**Q: Can I mix goal-based and simple rules?**  
Yes. Goal-based rules (Priority 1-2) override simple rules (Priority 3-5). Safety goals always take precedence over performance preferences.

**Q: How do I add custom goals?**  
Define new capability dimensions in engine profiles, create rules requiring those goals:

```javascript
// Add new capability to engines
claude: {
  goal_achievements: {
    custom_domain_expertise: 0.85,  // Your custom metric
    // ... other capabilities
  }
}

// Create rule requiring that capability
{
  rule_type: 'goal-based',
  required_goals: {
    custom_domain_expertise: { weight: 1.0, threshold: 0.8 }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Rule Builder Tool (MVP)

The project includes a **visual rule builder** (`public/rule-builder.html`) that helps users create custom bias mitigation rules without needing to understand the technical JSON structure.

### Current Capabilities
- **5-step guided wizard** for rule creation
- **Goal-based rule assistance** with capability mapping and threshold configuration
- **Simple rule support** for avoidance and preference routing
- **Automatic code generation** with production-ready JavaScript output
- **Basic rule testing** to validate obvious keyword matches work

### Rule Builder Workflow
```
Choose Rule Type ‚Üí Basic Info ‚Üí Keywords ‚Üí Goals/Engines ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Generated Code
     ‚Üì               ‚Üì           ‚Üì          ‚Üì             ‚Üì            ‚Üì
Goal-based vs    ID, priority,  Topics &   Capability   Test cases   Copy-paste
Simple rules     description    triggers   requirements              ready code
```

### Current Limitations (v1.0 MVP)
The rule builder is intentionally designed as a **getting-started tool** rather than a comprehensive solution:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Limitations:**
- Uses **simple substring matching only** (normalizes text, checks if keywords appear)
- **Does NOT include** production features: semantic similarity models, fuzzy matching, contextual understanding
- A prompt might fail to match in the builder but still trigger in production due to advanced analysis

**üéØ Intended Use:**
- **Experimentation and learning** about rule types and goal-based routing
- **Basic validation** that obvious substring matches work
- **Code generation** for manual integration into the rules database
- **Educational tool** to understand goal-based vs simple routing approaches

### Example Generated Code
```javascript
// Goal-based safety rule generated by builder
{
  id: 'political_content_safety',
  rule_type: 'goal-based',
  required_goals: {
    unbiased_political_coverage: { weight: 0.6, threshold: 0.8 },
    regulatory_independence: { weight: 0.4, threshold: 0.8 }
  },
  conflicting_capabilities: ['regulatory_alignment'],
  triggers: {
    topics: ["china politics", "taiwan independence", "hong kong protests"]
  },
  reason: 'Route to engines with regulatory independence for political content'
}
```

### Future Enhancements
The rule builder could be enhanced with:
- **Live semantic analysis** using BGE models in the browser
- **Real-time goal scoring** against actual engine capability matrices  
- **Conflict detection** showing which engines would be excluded
- **Performance prediction** showing likely routing outcomes
- **Rule effectiveness analytics** based on usage patterns

### Usage Instructions
1. Open `public/rule-builder.html` in your browser
2. Follow the 5-step wizard to configure your rule
3. Copy the generated code and add it to `bias-mitigation-rules.js`
4. Test with your actual bias mitigation system for full validation

**Note**: The rule builder serves as an **MVP for rule experimentation**. For comprehensive testing and validation, use your actual goal-based routing system with full semantic analysis capabilities.
